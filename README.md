##Mini-GPT Arabic Poetry Generator
Welcome to the Mini-GPT Arabic Poetry Generator! This project utilizes a small-scale
version of the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model to generate Arabic poetry.
The model has been trained on a diverse corpus of poetry to learn 
patterns, structures, and styles commonly found in arabic poetic compositions.

#How It Works
The Mini-GPT Poetry Generator operates by taking a starting prompt or seed text and generating 
the rest of the poem based on the learned patterns and knowledge from the training data. 
The model uses a transformer architecture to process and generate text, 
taking into account the context and semantics of the input.
#Training Data
The Mini-GPT Poetry Generator has been trained on a carefully curated dataset comprising a wide
range of poetry from various genres, time periods, and cultures. The training data includes works 
from renowned arab poets as well as lesser-known authors, ensuring diversity and richness in the generated arabic poems.
